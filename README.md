gJ# 📡 ESP8266 Security Camera  

A simple **ESP8266-based security camera simulation** that can trigger photo capture and send images over WiFi. This project demonstrates **IoT-enabled surveillance** and can be expanded for real-time monitoring.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📸 Capture images and send over WiFi  
- 🌐 Remote monitoring using a web server  
- ⚡ Lightweight and beginner-friendly  
- 🛠️ Expandable to integrate with cloud storage  
- 🔒 Learn IoT security monitoring basics  

---

## 🧰 Components Required
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU / ESP-12E)  
- Optional: Camera module (ESP32-CAM recommended for real video streaming)  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable for power

## 📌 Circuit Connections (Simulation)
```

ESP8266 pins -> connect to sensors or modules if needed
VCC          -> 3.3V
GND          -> GND

````
> For real-time video, use **ESP32-CAM**; ESP8266 can simulate photo capture or trigger actions.
